# 🛒 ShopKart

> A location-aware grocery & retail store discovery app for Android, built as a technical assignment using Jetpack Compose, Firebase, and the MVVM architecture pattern.

---

## 📱 Overview

ShopKart lets users discover nearby stores, search by category, and save recent searches — all with a sleek dark-themed UI and seamless Google Sign-In. It was built in 5 days as a technical assignment, navigating real-world challenges like deprecated APIs, Gradle breaking changes, and billing hurdles.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Hedgehog or later
- JDK 17+
- A Firebase project with **Google Sign-In** enabled
- (Optional) Google Places API key — app runs on mock data without it

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sarg3n7/shopkart.git
   cd shopkart
   ```

2. **Add `google-services.json`**  
   Download from your Firebase console and place it in the `app/` directory.

3. **Configure `local.properties`**  
   Add the following to your `local.properties` file (already in `.gitignore`):
   ```properties
   WEB_CLIENT_ID=your_web_client_id_here
   PLACES_API_KEY=your_places_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Sync and Build**  
   Open in Android Studio, let Gradle sync, and run on an emulator or device.

## ⚙️ Build Configuration Notes

This project targets AGP 9.1.0, which introduced breaking changes. The following fixes were applied:

- Removed the `kotlin-android` plugin (now built into AGP)
- Switched from `kapt` → **KSP `2.2.10-2.0.2`** for annotation processing
- Added `android.disallowKotlinSourceSets=false` to `gradle.properties`

---

## 🌍 Location & Store Data

Since the Google Places API legacy endpoints were deprecated on **March 1, 2025**, and Google billing setup encountered repeated failures during development, the app uses **realistic mock data** for stores in Bangalore.

- Default coordinates: `12.8460, 77.6817` (Electronic City Phase 2)
- All mock stores are placed near this location
- Distance is shown as **"📍 Nearby"** rather than a calculated value, since aerial (Haversine) distance diverged significantly from actual road distance — this was the most honest UX choice

---

## 🔒 Security

- `WEB_CLIENT_ID` and `PLACES_API_KEY` are stored in `local.properties`
- Exposed at build time via `BuildConfig` fields
- `local.properties` is included in `.gitignore` — secrets are never committed to version control

---

## 🧭 Firebase Remote Config

The app fetches the following keys from Firebase Remote Config at launch:

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `banner_text` | Promotional text shown on the Home screen |
| `featured_category` | Default category highlighted to the user |
| `default_radius` | Default search radius (in km) |

The Settings screen includes a **Remote Config debug panel** to inspect fetched values during development.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap / Known Limitations

- [ ] Replace mock data with live Google Places API once billing is resolved
- [ ] Add real-time road distance using the Distance Matrix API
- [ ] Implement store detail screen
- [ ] Add category filters on Results screen
- [ ] Write unit tests for ViewModels and Repository
